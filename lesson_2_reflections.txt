What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You need to start a repository before you can start commiting.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is used before you want to create a commit. Instead of commiting everything to a commit you can choose what you have modified.
